ONCE THE CLIENT CAN REFRESH FROM THE KAFKA QUEUE!!!!!
    need to establish a consumer web server (server side w/ socket.io) and then use socket.io to push data to the client
1. On the server side, set a timer for the game, send a message at half time (1 min), 
send a message at full time and stop the game from running

2. Create a hashmap of games (keeping track of scores, and game status), that will be accessed by the client for updating App.js, 
use Kafka to update the hashMap values (client side)

3. using the data in the hashMap create a separate component to display the games with the 
greatest and lowest score difference using a max and min heap
